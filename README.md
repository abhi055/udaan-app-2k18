I've experience of developing the android app for few months. 
I was given the task of developing this android app as an excercise.
In this app I was given to take a local json file and then the data from this file has to be fetched to the android app and finally this data has to be displayed as recycle view.
Initially the app starts with a button named as "Start" which is a textview. When this button is tapped, a new activity will be initiated.Then the following things will undergo:
First created the json object for data fetching and then created an array of this object. Then after this I'd created an adapter to store the array data. And then this is viewed as linear layout in recycle view.   
The contents from json file was taken into the program using file management.
